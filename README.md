# Algorithms And Big Data in Chemistry
This project was made for learning purposes: how to work with given set of data from a data-driven perspective
## Homework 1
For the first step, we needed to extract more than 1000 descriptors and perform data cleansing steps (validation, handling of missing values, detection of outliers, handling of duplicates, data transformation and normalization)
## Homework 2
The second step contains visualisation of our data, performing statistical analisys, calculation of correlation coefficients and implementing of linear and non-linear dimension reduction method
## Homework 3
Finally we needed to perform clustering algorithm, visualize and interpret our results. Then, apply automated feature engineering algorithms and automated feature selection in the context of machine learning problem
